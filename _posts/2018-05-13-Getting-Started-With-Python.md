### Let's get set up.

To get started with Python, the first thing you need is well, Python. Follow this link to [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/){:target="_blank"} and preferably get the latest version out (Python 3).

Another thing to take a look at is using Anaconda or Virtualenv to set up a Python virtual environment.
You'll find information on using [Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/overview.html){:target="_blank"} here and for virutalenv [this](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html){:target="_blank"} should help.

### A little Python history
Python has been around for a while now and it was created by Guido van Rossum. Guido continues to have an important
role in the development of Python and the direction it takes as a programming language. The Python community has dubbed
him as the Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL). <br>
Python's design philosophy focuses on readability of code. You'll notice when you start using Python that there are no brackets. To highlight blocks of code Python uses whitespaces. <br>
Python follows the [off-side rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule){:target="_blank"}.

### Running Python code
Now for the part we've all been waiting for. Open up your Python terminal and type the following command <br>
`print("Hello World")` <br>
There you go, you've written your first piece of Python code.
