### A little Python history
Python has been around for a while now and it was created by Guido van Rossum. Guido continues to have an important
role in the development of Python and the direction it takes as a programming language. The Python community has dubbed
him as the Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL). <br>
Python's design philosophy focuses on readability of code. You'll notice when you start using Python that there are no brackets. To highlight blocks of code Python uses whitespaces. <br>
Python follows the [off-side rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule){:target="_blank"}.

### Running Python code
Now for the part we've all been waiting for. Open up your Python terminal and type the following command <br>
`print("Hello World")`
There you go, you've written your first piece of Python code.
